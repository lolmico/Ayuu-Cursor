# Description
This is a custom Ayuu Chii cursor I made for our queen Ayuu Chii. It is based on the new Ayuu Heart emote. It has no animations. (I might add some in the future) Hope you enjoy.

# Free to edit
Feel free to edit/modify the cursor and you can even make a pull request or report bugs.

# Install
For now the only operating sistem that the cursor supports is Windows (Also feel free to make versions for linux and macOS)

# Windows

**1-** First you have to unzip the `ayuu_cursor.zip` for this you can use [7 Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) I recomend 7 Zip but both work. Place the unziped folder in a place you remember. (I recomend the documents folder)

**2-** Second you press the windows key or the windows icon on the taskbar
